# Component-based functional CSS - Examples

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Infos 
This is a example for my approach to a functional and component-based CSS structure. 

I talked about this topic at [FrontConf](https://frontconf.com/) in April 2019. Here you can find the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/programmiri/organise-your-styles-with-component-based-css-approach).

I also gave a talk about it at [c't < webdev >](https://ctwebdev.de/) in February 2019. You can find the [slides here](https://speakerdeck.com/programmiri/my-approach-to-a-component-based-css-f601400d-28ff-4b74-b3e2-5009b768d236).
